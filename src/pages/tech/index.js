        This website is severely over-engineered. Except for, maybe, the
        comments on the next page, the entire website would be better served
        using a static site generator, like Gatsby. However, the goal of this
        website is to show proof that I know, and can effectively work with, the
        technologies Meteor Development Group both uses and develops.
        <br />
        <br />
        All source code is available by clicking the link above. I have listed
        the more <strong>major</strong> technologies that I used below, along
        with a brief description of why.

        I firmly believe that, when applying for a job, you should use the
        product so that you are not going in <em>blind</em>. For this reason,
        development was done locally with GraphQL Yoga, Prisma, and Apollo
        Engine. Prisma states that, when deploying to a public cluster without
        logging in, the deploy will expire in 7 days. The uncertainty of when
        this website will be viewed made me swap to Graphcool for production.
        <br />
        <br />
        Ironically, Prisma removed Prisma Cloud from closed beta yesterday, but
        by that time I had already switched everything to Graphcool ðŸ˜….
